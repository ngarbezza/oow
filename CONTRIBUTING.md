Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. This project is particular because it does not stick to some JS conventions, but
the purpose is not that, but having a consistent way of teaching OO in a more pure way. Changes aligned with this
philosophy can be integrated.

If you add a new feature, please add a unit test for it on the `tests.js` file.
